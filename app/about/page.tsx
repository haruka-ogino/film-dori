      <h1>About this website</h1>
      <p>
        During my travels in Japan, I frequented locations that had inspired or
        been featured in some tv shows and films. I found that doing this
        allowed me to escape the busy crowds in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. These
        experiences were incredibly rewarding as I was able to better connect
        with the locals due to the lack of over-tourism and the places
        themselves as they had inspired stories I loved.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, I noticed that many foreign tourists struggled in finding these
        locations due to language barriers and lack of awareness. This inspired
        me to create an app to highlight these unique spots, by allowing users
        to discover and share locations tied to various media, both within and
        outside Japan.
        <br />
        <br />
        As Japan grapples with over-tourism, with the Japanese government
        encouraging visitors to explore lesser-known areas, this app aims to
        support this initiative by guiding users to the hidden gems that have
        inspired film, TV and more.
