# My App (name under construction)

Welcome to my app! A place to share locations that are inspired by or the inspiration to your favourite films and tv shows. Its aim is to encourage tourism in lesser known areas, putting less pressure on areas suffering from over-tourism.

## About

### Background

During my own travels in Japan, I frequented places that either inspired Ghibli films and Japanese dramas or were inspired by these. I did this to find cool places I would not have visited otherwise, and escape the busy crowds in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka.

### Methods used

* API endpoints
* React components
* database modules


## Installation - **From the command line**

```
git clone https://github.com/haruka-ogino/ghibli.git
cd ghibli-things
npm install # to install dependencies
npm run dev # to start the dev server
```

You can find the app running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
